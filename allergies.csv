Abalone,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=5011,"Allergy to shellfish such as abalone which are molluscs is less well known than allergy to shrimps (crustaceans). As with most food allergies, symptoms are usually mild such as oral allergy syndrome but severe symptoms such as anaphylactic shock can also occur after consumption. Note that abalone is not currently listed in annex IIIa of the EU directive on labelling of foods and thus individuals allergic to molluscs must be alert to the possibility of abalone or other molluscs as hidden allergens. Allergy to abalone is most commonly associated with allergy to other related shellfish such as limpet, snails, winkles and whelks (gastropods). Reactions can also be triggered by eating more distantly related molluscs such as clams, mussels, oysters, and scallops (bivalves) or cuttlefish, octopus and squid (cephalopods). Thus after a diagnosis of allergy to one mollusc, patients are normally advised to avoid all molluscs. Whilst most individuals with allergy to shrimps (crustacea) can tolerate molluscs, individuals with allergy to both types of shellfish have been reported. However, individuals allergic to finfish (such as cod or salmon) do not generally have allergies to shellfish.", 
Acerola,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=57,"There is only one case of a patient who developed a skin rash after drinking a glass of apple juice supplemented with acerola, who also had latex allergy. The allergy was associated with oral allergy syndrome to other plant foods."
Alaska Pollock,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=5017,"Allergy to fin fish is relatively common (0.4% of adults in the USA according to one telephone survey), and can be associated with severe symptoms such as anaphylactic shock. Symptoms can also occur after ingestion of only a small quantity of fish with one reported reaction in an individual after receiving a kiss from someone who had recently eaten fish. Allergy to fish is not to be confused with a toxic reaction to histamine in spoiled fish (scombroid fish poisoning). Almost all fish allergy seems to involve the protein parvalbumin, which is found in the muscle of most fish. As the parvalbumins are similar in all fish species, individuals allergic to one fish are likely to react to a range of different fish species. Thus after a diagnosis of allergy to one fish species, patients are normally advised to avoid all fin fish. Some individuals also react to frog. Although fin fish and shellfish allergies are not linked, individuals can be allergic to both foods.Parvalbumin remains able to cause a reaction after cooking. Thus fish remains allergenic after cooking and other treatments. Fish can be a ""hidden"" allergen in, for example, pizza toppings. Consequently, the EU labelling regulations require foods containing fish and products thereof to be labelled."
Almond,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=61,"Allergies to tree nuts and seeds tend to be of a more severe nature, causing life-threatening and sometimes fatal reactions. People with tree nut allergies also often suffer from reactions triggered by a number of different types of nuts, even though they do not come from closely related plant species. In general these allergies are triggered by the major proteins found in nuts and seeds which are resist processes such as cooking.There is also a milder form of tree nut allergy which is associated with birch pollen allergy, where symptoms are confined largely to the mouth, causing a condition called “oral allergy syndrome” (OAS). This condition is triggered by molecules found in tree nuts which are very similar to pollen allergens like the major birch pollen allergen called Bet v 1. These molecules tend to be destroyed by cooking, which can reduce the allergenicity of nuts and seeds for these allergic consumers.Reactions to nuts and seeds can also occur as a consequence of hidden nut ingredients or traces of nuts and certain seeds introduced as a consequence of food handling or manufacturing. As a result tree nuts and seeds have been included in Annex IIIa of the EU food labelling directive. The following (including products thereof) must be declared on a label if they have been deliberately included in a food:Almond, hazelnut, Walnut, Cashew, Pecan nut, Brazil nut, Pistachio nut, Macadamia nut Queensland nut, Mustard and Sesame seedsTemporary exceptions to the labelling rule (derogations) have been granted for Alcoholic berveragesFlavours"
Aniseed,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=62,"Aniseed allergy is relatively rare. The most common symptom reported is the oral allergy syndrome. However, anaphylaxis after eating aniseed has been reported and in one patient was associated with reactions to other spices such as caraway and coriander."
Apple,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=2,"Like many other allergies to fresh fruits and vegetables, apple allergy can take two different forms. In the North of Europe, people with birch-pollen allergy can develop an apple allergy due to the similarity between a protein in birch that causes birch-pollen allergy, and an apple protein. This is called the birch-apple syndrome with symptoms generally appearing within 5-15 min after consuming raw apple and comprising local reactions in the mouth and throat with itching and inflammation (called oral allergy syndrome, OAS). The molecule, known as an allergen, involved in this kind of allergy does not survive cooking and pasteurisation. Therefore, people who react to this allergen can tolerate cooked apple and juices. Individuals often develop adverse reactions to other fruits including pear, apricot, melon, banana, nuts such as hazelnut, or vegetables such as celeriac (celery tuber) and carrot.In Mediterranean countries, people with apple allergy do not have birch-pollen allergy. Instead they often have allergy to peach. These individuals develop adverse reactions to apple because of the similarity between the allergens in peach and apple. Symptoms are more severe including generalised urticaria, abdominal pain, vomiting and life-threatening symptoms, sometimes in addition to the OAS. These individuals tend to have more frequent and severe reactions when fruits are eaten with the peel. They also tend to develop adverse reactions to other fruits including peach, apricot, plum, cherry, nuts (such as hazelnut and walnut) and peanut. The protein (allergen) that causes this kind of allergy is tough and the allergenicity survives in processed foods such as purees, nectars and juices. As a result, individuals with this kind of allergy cannot eat even processed apple. The amount of allergen in the fruit is influenced by the apple variety, the degree of maturity and storage conditions. Whereas over-mature and freshly harvested fruits have highest levels of the peach related allergen, long storage increases the levels of pollen-related allergen. No hypoallergenic fruits have been produced by breeding so far."
Apricot,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=410,"Like many other allergies to fresh fruits and vegetables, apricot allergy can take two different forms.

Individuals with apricot allergy also tend to develop adverse reactions to other fruits including peach, apple, cherry, plum, and nuts (such as hazelnut and walnut)."
Avocado,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=4,"Avocado allergy can take two different forms: one associated with allergy to tree pollen, such as birch, and another type associated with latex allergy. People with birch-pollen allergy can develop symptoms either immediately or up to 1 hour after eating fresh avocado or an avocado-containing food. Symptoms comprise local reactions in the mouth and throat with itching and inflammation (called oral allergy syndrome, OAS). Others develop an avocado allergy because of the similarity between the allergens in avocado and natural rubber latex (e.g. gloves, condoms, balloons) a condition known as the latex-fruit syndrome. Symptoms developed by these individuals comprise generalised urticaria, abdominal pain, vomiting and sometimes life-threatening symptoms. These individuals may also develop adverse reactions to chestnut, banana, mango and kiwi."

Barley,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=63,"Adverse reactions to wheat have been more frequently reported than to other cereal-based foods. The best defined of these are coeliac disease and IgE-dependent wheat allergy, both of which result from malfunctioning of the immune system. Allergies to other cereals such as maize, sorghum and millet, are not common and are not related to reactions triggered by wheat, rye, barley and oats. As a consequence individuals with wheat allergy, including coeliac disease, can usually eat maize-based foods such as polenta. However, allergic reactions to maize can result from the fruit allergies found in the South of Europe which often start with reactions to peach. Coeliac disease is triggered by the gluten fraction of wheat or by the gluten-like proteins found in other closely related cereals such as rye, barley. Some sensitive individuals may also react to oats. The gut reacts to the gluten and becomes smooth, loosing its ability to absorb nutrients; symptoms including diarrhoea as well as deficiencies in nutrients like vitamins. It can manifest itself in childhood, affecting children’s growth and development, or in adult hood. As there is no cure individuals with coeliac disease have to avoid eating gluten for life. However, coeliac disease does not cause the potentially fatal reaction of anaphylaxis if gluten is accidentally eaten. In contrast IgE-mediated cereal allergies can be caused by the antibody molecule IgE binding to many proteins, not just gluten. Sometimes the reactions (often severe) only develop if an individual takes exercise within a few hours of eating wheat or related cereals, in a condition called exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Individuals with wheat allergy often react to closely related cereals like barley and rye, less frequently to the more distant relative, oats. Diagnosis of cereal allergies can be complicated by the fact that some of the blood tests for cereal food allergy can accidentally detect allergy to grass pollens instead. As a consequence of these adverse reactions, cereals containing gluten, (i.e. wheat, rye, barley, oats, spelt or their hybridized strains) have been included in Annex IIIa of the food labelling directive along with derived products. Temporary exceptions to the labelling rule (derogations) have been granted for wheat based glucose syrups including dextrose, wheat based maltodextrins, glucose syrups based on barley and cereals used in distillates for spirits."
Bell pepper,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=58,Allergy to bell pepper is commonly reported with respiratory symptoms rather than reactions of the mouth or skin (most commonly rhinoconjunctivitis but also asthma) which is slightly unusual. Headaches were also reported which are sometimes associated with allergic rhinitis but are otherwise rarely reported as a symptom of food allergy. Allergy to bell pepper is often associated with the celery-birch-mugwort-spice syndrome.

Buckwheat,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=12,"Buckwheat, despite its name, is not botanically related to wheat. Thus individuals who are allergic to wheat, barley, rye and similar cereals can usually eat buckwheat. Similarly, buckwheat flour can be safely used by individuals with coeliac disease (provided that it has been milled separately from wheat, rye, barley or oats). Allergy to buckwheat is one of the more common food allergies in Korea and Japan. As with most food allergens, the most common symptoms involve the skin, especially urticaria (hives). Severe symptoms such as anaphylaxis have been reported and also exercise induced anaphylaxis i.e. anaphylaxis which only occurs when consumption is followed within a few hours by exercise such as running.Buckwheat is not named in the European or American labelling regulations but labelling of buckwheat is mandatory in Japan, reflecting the much higher prevalence of this allergy in Asia."
Camomile,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=59,"Individuals allergic to pollen from a weed called mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) can develop an allergy to camomile because of the similarity between the allergens (proteins) in both plants. They react to the herb with respiratory tract symptoms (e.g.wheezing), vomiting, cramps, diarrhoea or even more severe reactions like a skin rash. Individuals react to dried, boiled or fresh camomile plants or extracts."

Lupin or Lupine,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=32,"Lupin is peanut's closest relative amongst foods and it has been estimated that approximately 50% of individuals with peanut allergy can react to lupin. Thus the addition of lupin to flour was soon followed by reports of allergic reactions to this hidden and generally unlabelled allergen. In France, the first report of lupin anaphylaxis was in 1999 but by 2002, lupin was the fourth most frequent cause of severe food-associated anaphylaxis reported to the French Allergy Vigilance Network. However, although most cases have involved individuals allergic to peanut, there is at least one report of an individual allergic to lupin and some legumes (chickpea, lentil and white beans) who could tolerate peanut. The reported symptoms of allergic individuals after eating lupin include oral itching and urticaria (hives) and angioedema (wheals) of the skin as well as more severe symptoms (anaphylaxis). Several cases have included acute asthma or breathing difficulty due to throat swelling.

Some unusual symptoms such as failure to thrive or the frequency of atopic dermatitis as a symptom reflect the age of onset.Individuals who are allergic to cow's milk are very likely to also react to sheep's or goat's milk. Milk from other species such as horse or camel may sometimes be tolerated. Milk and products thereof (including lactose) are listed in annex IIIa of the EU directive on labelling of pre-packaged foods."
Mustard,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=56,"Allergies to tree nuts and seeds tend to be of a more severe nature, causing life-threatening and sometimes fatal reactions. People with tree nut allergies also often suffer from reactions triggered by a number of different types of nuts, even though they do not come from closely related plant species. In general these allergies are triggered by the major proteins found in nuts and seeds which are resist processes such as cooking.There is also a milder form of tree nut allergy which is associated with birch pollen allergy, where symptoms are confined largely to the mouth, causing a condition called “oral allergy syndrome” (OAS). This condition is triggered by molecules found in tree nuts which are very similar to pollen allergens like the major birch pollen allergen called Bet v 1. These molecules tend to be destroyed by cooking, which can reduce the allergenicity of nuts and seeds for these allergic consumers.Reactions to nuts and seeds can also occur as a consequence of hidden nut ingredients or traces of nuts and certain seeds introduced as a consequence of food handling or manufacturing. As a result tree nuts and seeds have been included in Annex IIIa of the EU food labelling directive. The following (including products thereof) must be declared on a label if they have been deliberately included in a food:Almond, hazelnut, Walnut, Cashew, Pecan nut, Brazil nut, Pistachio nut, Macadamia nut Queensland nut, Mustard and Sesame seedsTemporary exceptions to the labelling rule (derogations) have been granted for Alcoholic berveragesFlavours"
Oat,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=35,"Adverse reactions to wheat have been more frequently reported than to other cereal-based foods. The best defined of these are coeliac disease and IgE-dependent wheat allergy, both of which result from malfunctioning of the immune system. Allergies to other cereals such as maize, sorghum and millet, are not common and are not related to reactions triggered by wheat, rye, barley and oats. As a consequence individuals with wheat allergy, including coeliac disease, can usually eat maize-based foods such as polenta. However, allergic reactions to maize can result from the fruit allergies found in the South of Europe which often start with reactions to peach. Coeliac disease is triggered by the gluten fraction of wheat or by the gluten-like proteins found in other closely related cereals such as rye, barley. Some sensitive individuals may also react to oats. The gut reacts to the gluten and becomes smooth, loosing its ability to absorb nutrients; symptoms including diarrhoea as well as deficiencies in nutrients like vitamins. It can manifest itself in childhood, affecting children’s growth and development, or in adult hood. As there is no cure individuals with coeliac disease have to avoid eating gluten for life. However, coeliac disease does not cause the potentially fatal reaction of anaphylaxis if gluten is accidentally eaten. In contrast IgE-mediated cereal allergies can be caused by the antibody molecule IgE binding to many proteins, not just gluten. Sometimes the reactions (often severe) only develop if an individual takes exercise within a few hours of eating wheat or related cereals, in a condition called exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Individuals with wheat allergy often react to closely related cereals like barley and rye, less frequently to the more distant relative, oats. Diagnosis of cereal allergies can be complicated by the fact that some of the blood tests for cereal food allergy can accidentally detect allergy to grass pollens instead. As a consequence of these adverse reactions, cereals containing gluten, (i.e. wheat, rye, barley, oats, spelt or their hybridized strains) have been included in Annex IIIa of the food labelling directive along with derived products. Temporary exceptions to the labelling rule (derogations) have been granted for wheat based glucose syrups including dextrose, wheat based maltodextrins, glucose syrups based on barley and cereals used in distillates for spirits."
Oyster,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=5012,"Allergy to shellfish such as oyster is less well known than allergy to crustaceans. As with most food allergies, symptoms are usually mild such as oral allergy syndrome, but severe symptoms such as anaphylactic shock can also occur after consumption. Note that oysters are not currently listed in annex IIIa of the EU directive on labelling of foods and thus individuals allergic to molluscs must be alert to the possibility of oyster or other molluscs as hidden allergens. Since oysters are bivalve molluscs, allergy to oyster is most commonly associated with allergy to other bivalves such as clams, mussels, and scallops. Reaction is also likely after ingestion of more distantly related molluscs such as limpet, snails, winkles and whelks (gastropods) or cuttlefish, octopus and squid (cephalopods). Thus, after a diagnosis of allergy to one mollusc, patients are normally advised to avoid all molluscs. Whilst most individuals with allergy to shrimps (crustacea) can tolerate molluscs, individuals with allergy to both types of shellfish have been reported. However, individuals allergic to finfish (such as cod or salmon) do not generally have allergies to shellfish."
Peach,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=37,"Like many other allergies to fresh fruits and vegetables, peach allergy can take two different forms. In the North of Europe, people with birch-pollen allergy can develop a peach allergy due to the similarity between a protein in birch that causes birch-pollen allergy, and a peach protein. This is called the birch-fruit syndrome with symptoms generally appearing within 5-15 min after consuming raw peach and comprising local reactions in the mouth and throat with itching and inflammation (called oral allergy syndrome, OAS). The molecule, known as an allergen, involved in this kind of allergy does not survive cooking. Therefore, people who react to this allergen can tolerate cooked peach and juices. Individuals often develop adverse reactions to other fruits including apple, pear, apricot, cherry, melon, banana, nuts such as hazelnut, or vegetables such as celeriac (celery tuber) and carrot.In Mediterranean countries, people with peach allergy do not have birch-pollen allergy. Symptoms are more severe including generalised urticaria, abdominal pain, vomiting and life-threatening symptoms, sometimes in addition to the OAS. These individuals tend to have more frequent and severe reactions when fruits are eaten with the peel. They also tend to develop adverse reactions to other fruits including apple, apricot, plum, cherry, nuts (such as hazelnut and walnut) and peanut. The protein (allergen) that causes this kind of allergy is tough and the allergenicity survives in processed foods such as purees, nectars and juices. As a result, individuals with this kind of allergy cannot eat even cooked peach."
Peanut,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=38,"The prevalence of allergy to peanut has been estimated as between 0.3% to 1.5% in studies from Britain, Canada, France and the USA. These studies are hard to compare as different age groups were studied with the highest 1.5% estimate from 3-4 year olds from the Isle of Wight (UK). Much lower prevalences seem to occur in some other countries despite high peanut consumptions.The symptoms of allergic individuals after eating peanut range from relatively mild symptoms, such as the oral allergy syndrome, to severe symptoms requiring emergency treatment such as anaphylaxis or asthma (severe symptoms seem more common with peanut than with most food allergies). Skin reactions such as urticaria (hives) or angioedema (wheals) are the most common symptoms.Peanut is the commonest cause of fatal food-related allergic reactions. Thus peanut and products thereof are listed in annex IIIa of the EU directive on labelling of foods. It is also listed as a major food allergen by the FDA (USA) labelling regulations.Allergy to peanut is associated with allergy to certain legumes such as lupin, with approximately 50% of peanut allergic individuals reacting to lupin. Whilst many peanut allergy sufferers have IgE to soya, they rarely suffer a reaction on eating soya. Peanut allergic individuals frequently react to tree nuts despite the absence of a close botanical relationship. Recently, some birch pollen allergic patients have been shown to react to peanut."
Pear,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=39,"Like many other allergies to fresh fruits and vegetables, pear allergy can take two different forms.

Pine nuts,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=41,Allergy to pine nuts has been reported less frequently than allergy to tree nuts and pine is botanically only distantly related to other food plants. Thus pine nuts are not currently listed in annex IIIa of the EU directive on labelling of pre-packaged foods. Severe reactions including anaphylactic shock have been reported but few of the patients who were suspected to have reacted to pine nuts recalled eating pine nuts. This is possibly because these nuts are used for flavouring and are thus often hidden ingredients. Some tree nut or peanut allergic individuals may react to pine nuts.
Potato,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=45,"Potato is considered a rarely allergenic food and is frequently used in elimination diets and as part of the placebo in challenge protocols. However, more than 50 cases of food allergy after eating cooked potato have been reported and skin prick tests suggest that sensitization to raw potato is relatively common.  Cases of contact allergy to raw potatoes have also been reported. The symptoms reported include reactions of the skin such as urticaria (hives), angioedema (wheals) and eczema, respiratory symptoms such as rhinitis, cough and wheezing and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea. Most reactions occurred within 2 hours (immediate reactions) but delayed reactions have also been reported.Allergy to cooked potato is related to tomato allergy and to latex allergy.  Sensitization to raw potato may also be related to pollen allergies."
Rice,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=47,"Rice allergy seems uncommon in Europe or America but the reported symptoms have involved the skin (urticaria), respiratory symptoms (asthma), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea) and anaphylatic shock, sometimes induced by exercise. Rice allergy is reported as more common in Japan and has been associated with atopic ezcema. Rice and rice flour can be eaten by individuals with wheat allergy or coeliac disease."

Salmon,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=5022,"Allergy to fin fish is relatively common (0.4% of adults in the USA according to one telephone survey), and can be associated with severe symptoms such as anaphylactic shock. Symptoms can also occur after ingestion of only a small quantity of fish with one reported reaction in an individual after receiving a kiss from someone who had recently eaten fish. Allergy to fish is not to be confused with a toxic reaction to histamine in spoiled fish (scombroid fish poisoning). Almost all fish allergy seems to involve the protein parvalbumin, which is found in the muscle of most fish. As the parvalbumins are similar in all fish species, individuals allergic to one fish are likely to react to a range of different fish species. Thus after a diagnosis of allergy to one fish species, patients are normally advised to avoid all fin fish. Some individuals also react to frog. Although fin fish and shellfish allergies are not linked, individuals can be allergic to both foods.Parvalbumin remains able to cause a reaction after cooking. Thus fish remains allergenic after cooking and other treatments. Fish can be a ""hidden"" allergen in, for example, pizza toppings. Consequently, the EU labelling regulations require foods containing fish and products thereof to be labelled."

Shrimp,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=5028,"Shrimp along with crayfish, crabs and lobsters are crustaceans. Food allergy to crustaceans is relatively common, symptoms ranging from mild oral allergy to severe symptoms such as anaphylaxis. Cooking does not remove the allergen. Crustacea are the third most important cause of food induced anaphylaxis after peanuts and tree nuts (cashews, almonds, pecans, walnuts, etc.). Thus crustacea and products thereof are listed in annex IIIa of the EU directive on labelling of foods and must be labelled when used as ingredients in pre-packaged food. Most allergy to crustacea seems to involve a muscles protein called tropomyosin, which is very similar in a wide range of crustacean foods. As a result someone with allergy to tropomyosin from one kind of crustacean is likely to react to others. Thus individuals with allergy to one kind of crustacean are usually advised to avoid all types of crustacean foods.In addition, some individuals with allergies to insects such as cockroach or moths can suffer food allergy to crustacean foods. Whilst most individuals with allergy to shrimps (crustacea) can tolerate molluscs, individuals with allergy to both types of shellfish have been reported.

Snail,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=5010,"Allergy to molluscs such as snail is less common than allergy to shrimps. Snail allergy is associated with an unusual distribution of symptoms with asthma being very frequently reported. However, mild symptoms such as oral allergy syndrome, urticaria (hives) and severe symptoms such as anaphylactic shock can also occur after consumption.Allergy to snail is frequently associated with allergy to dust mites and this may account for the high frequency of asthma and rhinitis seen as symptoms. There are also concerns that desensitization therapy with dust mite extracts may cause a more severe reaction to snails. Some individuals with allergy to shrimp (crustacea) may also suffer associated allergy to snail. For others, their allergy to snail is associated with allergy to other shellfish (molluscs) such as abalone and limpet which can include serious or fatal reactions."
Soybean,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=50,"Although there are many reported cases of food allergy to soybean, the true prevalence is difficult to determine because sera from individuals with allergy to other legumes may have IgE to soya but only a few of these individuals actually react after consuming soybean products. The symptoms of allergic individuals after eating soybean range from relatively mild symptoms, such as the oral allergy syndrome, to severe symptoms requiring emergency treatment such as anaphylaxis or asthma. There is one report of anaphylaxis occurring only when exercise followed eating soybean (exercise induced anaphylaxis).There are significant differences in the reported reactions to the molecular allergens of soybean between different regions of the world with different allergens being involved in Japan compared to North America or Europe. The basis of these differences is not understood but may relate to differences in food consumption or to factors such as allergy to tree pollens such as birch.Soya is considered one of the most important food allergens. Thus soybeans and products thereof are listed in annex IIIa of the EU directive on labelling of foods. It is also listed as a major food allergen by the FDA (USA) labelling regulations. Soybean is one of the most difficult foods for the allergic consumer to avoid as it is used in many processed foods. It is thus the classic ""hidden allergen""."
Squid,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=5009,"Allergy to molluscs such as squid is less common than allergy to shrimps (crustaceans).

Tomato,http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-food/?FoodId=52,"More than 50 cases of food allergy after eating tomato have been reported. In general, tomato allergy is associated with allergy to either latex or pollen. The symptoms reported were rather different in the two groups. The patients with no latex allergy reported mostly the oral allergy syndrome with some skin reactions such as urticaria (hives). Patients with latex allergy reported urticaria as the most common reaction but 20% suffered anaphylaxis. Allergy to tomato is also linked to allergy to potato since they are related plants."
